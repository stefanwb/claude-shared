# claude-docker

Run Claude Code in a container that inherits your setup but not your filesystem. Workspace access is scoped to the directories you pass in; your statusline, skills, agents, and slash commands ride along as read-only bind-mounts. CLI tools are preinstalled (`gh`, `glab`, `aws`, `openspec`, `uv`, `pnpm`, `tfenv`, `git-lfs`) — language runtimes are not: `tfenv` and `uv` fetch your project-pinned Terraform / Python on demand. Host credentials (`gh`, `glab`, `aws`, `tfe`) are opt-in per flag; nothing leaks in by default. An optional `--gateway` flag routes the model traffic itself through a self-hosted LLM gateway (e.g. LiteLLM) for outage redundancy or non-Anthropic models.

The VCS and cloud CLIs (`gh`, `glab`, `aws`) need a flag to see host credentials — see [Credential opt-in](#credential-opt-in). The rest work out of the box.

## Install

```bash
# Build the image from your checkout (one-time; rerun after Dockerfile changes)
docker build -t claude-code:local ./claude-docker

# Put on your PATH (create ~/bin if it doesn't exist)
mkdir -p ~/bin
ln -s "$(pwd)/claude-docker/run.sh" ~/bin/claude-docker
```

## Usage

```bash
claude-docker                             # current dir as workspace
claude-docker ~/repo-a ~/repo-b           # multi-workspace
claude-docker --yolo ~/repo               # alias for --dangerously-skip-permissions
claude-docker ~/repo -- --resume          # any claude flag after --
```

`claude-docker --help` (or `-h`) prints every wrapper flag with a one-line explanation — the canonical reference.

### Credential opt-in

**Credentials are off by default.** No AWS / GitHub / GitLab / Terraform Cloud / LLM-gateway config, tokens, or env vars reach the container unless you explicitly opt in:

| Flag         | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| `--aws`      | Mount `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/sso/` read-only and forward `AWS_PROFILE` / `AWS_REGION` / `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` / `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`. `~/.aws/credentials` (long-lived keys) and `~/.aws/cli/cache/` are **not** mounted. |
| `--gh`       | Forward `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN`; if neither is set on the host, the wrapper extracts a token via `gh auth token` (host keychain) and forwards that. Unmasks in-container `gh auth login` state persisted in `claude-code-root` — without this flag, `/root/.config/gh/` is hidden by a tmpfs overlay so a prior login can't leak into a non-opted-in session. |
| `--glab`     | Mount the platform-appropriate `glab-cli` config dir read-only (macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/glab-cli`, Linux: `~/.config/glab-cli`) and forward `GITLAB_TOKEN`. Unmasks in-container `glab auth login` state — without the flag, `/root/.config/glab-cli/` is hidden by a tmpfs overlay. |
| `--tfe`      | Mount `~/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json` read-only when present and forward `TF_TOKEN_app_terraform_io`. Targets `app.terraform.io` (HCP Terraform) only — self-hosted Terraform Enterprise hostnames and other `TF_TOKEN_<host>` variables are not forwarded. Unmasks in-container `terraform login` state — without the flag, `/root/.terraform.d/` is hidden by a tmpfs overlay. See [Terraform Cloud workflow](#terraform-cloud-workflow). |
| `--gateway`  | Route Claude Code through an Anthropic-Messages-compatible LLM gateway (e.g. a self-hosted LiteLLM proxy) for outage redundancy or non-Anthropic models. Forward `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` (bearer) and, when set, the model overrides `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` / `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_{OPUS,SONNET,HAIKU,FABLE}_MODEL` and `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY`. Masks the Anthropic OAuth credential for the session (see below) so auth comes solely from the forwarded token. See [LLM gateway workflow](#llm-gateway-workflow). |

Combine as needed: `claude-docker --aws --gh ~/repo`.

### Session flags

| Flag            | Effect |
|-----------------|--------|
| `--ephemeral`   | Skip the persistent named volumes. No in-container auth state, shell history, or conversation history persists across runs. |
| `--ro`          | Mount every workspace read-only. Prevents the agent from modifying your code. |

`--ro` does **not** block credential flags or restrict network egress — for an isolated review session, combine `--ephemeral` and `--ro` and pass no credential flags:

```bash
claude-docker --ephemeral --ro ~/untrusted-repo
```

For `--iterm` / `--tmux` (teammate split panes), see [Split-pane agent teams](#split-pane-agent-teams). In-container YOLO narrows the blast radius compared to running on the host, but see [Threat model](#threat-model) for what it does and doesn't protect.

### Resuming sessions across workspaces

Conversation history persists in the shared `claude-code-home` volume (skipped under `--ephemeral`), so `claude --resume` followed by `Ctrl+A` lists sessions from every workspace you've ever used — not just the one you're currently in.

## Host config parity

On every run, these items are dereferenced (symlinks resolved) and bind-mounted read-only into the container at the equivalent `/root/.claude/` path:

| Item                              | Purpose                             |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `~/.claude/agents/`               | custom agent definitions            |
| `~/.claude/skills/`               | custom skills                       |
| `~/.claude/commands/`             | slash commands                      |
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`             | global preferences (`gprefs`)       |
| `~/.claude/statusline-command.sh` | statusline renderer                 |

For `settings.json`, maintain a dedicated `~/.claude/settings.docker.json` (any valid Claude `settings.json` schema) — it's bind-mounted at `/root/.claude/settings.json` when present. Keeping it separate from your host `settings.json` avoids dragging macOS-only keys (`sandbox`, `env.SSL_CERT_FILE`, `enabledPlugins`) or host-filesystem `hooks` into the container. See [`examples/settings.docker.json`](examples/settings.docker.json) for a starting point.

### Alternate Claude config dirs (`--claude-dir`)

If you keep more than one host Claude config (e.g. a personal `~/.claude/` and a work-only `~/.claude-work/`), point the wrapper at the one you want with `--claude-dir=PATH` or the `CLAUDE_DOCKER_CONFIG_DIR` env var:

```bash
claude-docker --claude-dir=~/.claude-work ~/repo
CLAUDE_DOCKER_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-work claude-docker ~/repo
```

The chosen dir takes the place of `~/.claude` for every item in the parity table above (agents, skills, commands, `CLAUDE.md`, statusline, `settings.docker.json`).

### Git identity

`user.name` and `user.email` from your global git config (`~/.gitconfig`) are forwarded automatically as `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`/`GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`/`GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`/`GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` so in-container `git commit` works out of the box with your real identity — no `git -c user.email=...` dance, no wrong-author commits. Not gated by a flag: identity is already public on every commit you've made. Signing keys, credential helpers, aliases, and hooks are NOT forwarded — those are host-specific (keychains, absolute paths) and would misfire inside the container.

### Statusline tag for active opt-ins

`run.sh` exports `CLAUDE_DOCKER_FLAGS` into the container with the comma-separated list of active opt-ins (`gh`, `aws`, `glab`, `tfe`, `gateway`, `ephemeral`, `ro`) and wraps the host statusline script so a yellow `docker:<flags>` tag is prepended to whatever your personal statusline renders. The variable is set by the wrapper for the statusline to read — not a user-tunable knob. `--yolo` / `--dangerously-skip-permissions` is not surfaced here — Claude Code's own mode indicator already makes it obvious. The wrapper is a no-op passthrough when no opt-ins are active, so your statusline looks unchanged on a plain `claude-docker ~/repo`.

The image sets `IS_SANDBOX=1` — historically required to let `--yolo` / `--dangerously-skip-permissions` work when claude ran as root. The entrypoint now drops to the host UID before exec'ing claude, so the root-user check no longer triggers in steady state; `IS_SANDBOX=1` remains as a safety net for the legacy `HOST_UID=0` fall-through path. OS-level hardening comes from `--cap-drop ALL` (with `CHOWN`, `SETUID`, `SETGID`, `DAC_READ_SEARCH` re-added for transient entrypoint use only), `--security-opt no-new-privileges`, the Docker default seccomp profile, `--init` (tini reaps subprocess zombies), and the bind-mount layout. See [File ownership](#file-ownership) and [Threat model](#threat-model) below.

## Auth model

Credentials are opt-in per run — see [Credential opt-in](#credential-opt-in) above for the per-flag effect, mounts, and env-var forwarding. The subsections below cover the workflows that need more than a one-line table cell.

### AWS SSO flow (`--aws`)

Standard SSO usage works unchanged: `aws sso login --profile X && export AWS_PROFILE=X` on the host, then `claude-docker --aws`. The container reads the short-lived SSO bearer token from `~/.aws/sso/cache` via the read-only mount.

If you'd rather not mount `sso/cache` either, flatten to env vars after login:

```bash
aws sso login --profile X
eval "$(aws configure export-credentials --profile X --format env)"
claude-docker --aws ...
```

Container then uses `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`SECRET`/`SESSION_TOKEN` and the SSO cache is not needed inside. Temp creds freeze at container start (~1h TTL).

### Terraform Cloud workflow

Standard usage targets `app.terraform.io` (HCP Terraform):

```bash
# One-time on the host: writes ~/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json
terraform login app.terraform.io

# Per session
claude-docker --tfe ~/repo

# Inside the container, fetch the project-pinned terraform version
tfenv install            # reads .terraform-version, downloads from releases.hashicorp.com
terraform plan
```

The image ships `tfenv` (a pure-bash terraform version manager) and **does not** ship a pre-installed `terraform` binary version — versions are project-pinned (`required_version` / `.terraform-version`) and a single bundled version would drift against real workspaces. `tfenv install` writes terraform binaries under `/opt/tfenv/versions/`, which is **not** in the `claude-code-root` named volume; downloads do not persist across `docker run --rm` exits. Power users can build a child image (`FROM claude-code:local`) that runs `tfenv install <version>` at build time to bake a specific version into a derived image.

Token alternative: instead of (or in addition to) the credentials file, export `TF_TOKEN_app_terraform_io=<token>` on the host and `--tfe` will forward it. The terraform CLI honours both.

### LLM gateway workflow

`--gateway` points Claude Code at an Anthropic-Messages-compatible LLM gateway instead of `api.anthropic.com` — useful as an outage fallback and for reaching non-Anthropic models the gateway fronts (e.g. via a self-hosted LiteLLM proxy). Standing up the gateway itself is out of scope here; the wrapper only forwards the connection settings and isolates your Anthropic credential.

Claude Code always speaks the Anthropic wire format to the gateway regardless of which backend it routes to, so a non-Anthropic model is just a **model id** — you do not need autodiscovery. Set it explicitly one of two ways:

**Option 1 — set the model directly (simplest).** `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` takes a literal id and overrides everything else (`settings.docker.json`, the `opus[1m]` pin). Whatever string you put here is sent straight to the gateway:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://litellm.internal:4000
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=sk-litellm-...
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL=gpt-4o                    # main model — must match a LiteLLM model_name
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini # background/fast model (see below)
claude-docker --gateway ~/repo
```

**Option 2 — remap the aliases.** Keep the alias-based UX (the `opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku` entries in the `/model` picker and the `"model": "opus[1m]"` in `settings.docker.json`) but remap what each alias resolves to:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://litellm.internal:4000
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=sk-litellm-...
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL=bedrock-claude-sonnet  # what "opus" becomes
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL=gemini-pro
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
claude-docker --gateway ~/repo
```

Note the `[1m]` suffix in the default `settings.docker.json` is an Anthropic context-window variant and means nothing to a non-Anthropic backend — with a gateway, prefer Option 1 (`ANTHROPIC_MODEL`) to avoid that ambiguity.

Notes:

- **Background model.** Claude Code makes background/fast calls against the haiku slot; if your gateway doesn't serve whatever haiku resolves to, those calls fail — so always point `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` at a small model it does serve. This is the easiest part to miss.
- **Model ids are LiteLLM names.** The ids above must match the `model_name` values in your LiteLLM `model_list` config exactly — not the upstream provider's name. Check your gateway config for the right strings.
- **Autodiscovery is optional.** `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1` only populates the in-session `/model` picker from the gateway's `/v1/models` so you can switch interactively — it's a convenience on top of the env vars above, never a requirement. You can also just type a model id into `/model` without it.
- **Credential isolation.** In `--gateway` mode the wrapper masks the persisted Anthropic OAuth token (`/root/.claude/.credentials.json`) with an empty read-only overlay, so a session routed through a third-party gateway can neither use nor read your subscription credential — auth comes solely from `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`. This also means OAuth / `claude login` is unavailable while the flag is set; drop the flag to go back to the Anthropic API on your subscription. Session and project history under `/root/.claude/projects/` still persists and stays unified across gateway and non-gateway runs, so `claude --resume` lists them together.

## File ownership

Files created inside the container appear on the host owned by the user who launched `claude-docker`, not by `root`. The wrapper forwards `HOST_UID` / `HOST_GID` and the in-container entrypoint creates a matching passwd entry and drops to it via `runuser` before exec'ing claude. Persistent state in the `claude-code-root` and `claude-code-home` named volumes is chowned on first start, so an existing volume from before this change is fixed up the next time you run `claude-docker`.

## Threat model

The container narrows blast radius vs. running `claude --yolo` on the host, but it is **not** a full sandbox:

- **Protected:** host filesystem outside your passed workspaces, host `~/.aws/credentials` (long-lived keys), host AWS/glab config dirs are read-only from inside (container can't persist changes back).
- **Exposed (per session):** your passed workspaces are read-write (unless `--ro`); host credentials when opted in — short-lived AWS SSO bearer tokens (`~/.aws/sso/cache`), the glab config token, `~/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json`, and `GH_TOKEN` / `GITLAB_TOKEN` / `TF_TOKEN_app_terraform_io` / `AWS_*` env vars are all readable inside the container; under `--gateway`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` (your gateway key) are readable inside too; full outbound network with no egress filtering.
- **Exposed (cross-session):** the persistent `claude-code-root` and `claude-code-home` named volumes hold the Claude OAuth token, in-container `gh` / `glab` / `terraform login` state, shell history, and conversation history. `claude --resume` can replay sessions from **any** past workspace — see [Resuming sessions across workspaces](#resuming-sessions-across-workspaces). Skipped under `--ephemeral`.
- **Anthropic credential isolation under `--gateway`:** when routing through a third-party gateway, the persisted Anthropic OAuth token (`/root/.claude/.credentials.json`) is masked by an empty read-only overlay so it is neither used nor readable in that session — the gateway sees only the `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` you forwarded, never your subscription credential. The mask is non-destructive: the token reappears on the next non-gateway run.
- **Runtime code-fetch:** `npx`, `pnpm dlx`, `uvx`, and `tfenv install` fetch and execute arbitrary code from public sources on first use — npm and PyPI for the package managers, `releases.hashicorp.com` for `tfenv install`. Under `--yolo`, a prompt-injected workspace can trigger these. `pnpm dlx` adds zero marginal blast radius vs the already-reachable `npx`; `uvx` is a *new* PyPI execution primitive (no Python runtime existed in the image before); `tfenv install` is a *new* HashiCorp release-channel execution primitive whose downloaded `terraform` binary is intentionally **not** sha256-pinned in the image (versions are project-pinned via `.terraform-version`, so the image stays neutral on version policy). Build-time installs of the CLIs themselves are pinned by version + sha256 where the ecosystem supports it (uv binary, glab .deb, AWS CLI, tfenv source archive), and by version only for npm-backed packages (claude-code, openspec, pnpm) — `--ignore-scripts` blocks lifecycle scripts at install time but does not protect against a compromised registry serving a malicious tarball at the pinned version.
- **If a session is compromised:** assume exfiltration already happened (full network egress). Then: rotate the host sessions for every flag that was passed (`gh auth refresh` / re-login, `glab auth login`, `aws sso login`, `terraform login`), revoke the Claude OAuth credential, and clear the named volumes (`docker volume rm claude-code-root claude-code-home`) to flush in-container auth state and cross-workspace conversation history that `claude --resume` could otherwise replay.

Hardening applied at runtime: `--cap-drop ALL --cap-add CHOWN --cap-add SETUID --cap-add SETGID --cap-add DAC_READ_SEARCH` — the four added caps are held only during entrypoint setup and cleared from the effective / permitted / ambient sets by the kernel when the entrypoint drops UID 0 → host UID (the bounding set retains them but is inert under `no-new-privileges`), so claude itself runs with no usable capabilities; `--security-opt no-new-privileges`; `--init` (tini reaps subprocess zombies — `runuser` would otherwise be PID 1); container starts as root and drops to the host user before exec'ing claude (see [File ownership](#file-ownership)); the Docker default seccomp profile; scoped workspace bind-mounts; tmpfs masks over non-opted-in credential paths. Build-time: pinned base image digest, sha256-verified downloads where the ecosystem supports it (uv, glab, AWS CLI, tfenv source); npm packages (claude-code, openspec, pnpm) are version-pinned with `--ignore-scripts` but not sha256-verified — a compromised npm registry serving a malicious tarball at the pinned version would not be caught at build time. **Not** applied: read-only root filesystem, user-namespace remapping, custom seccomp profile (Docker's default is in use), network egress filtering, resource limits.

## Git worktrees

Git worktrees embed the path between the worktree and its repo's `.git/` in two link files. By default those paths are absolute, so a worktree created on the host breaks inside the container (and vice versa) because the same files sit at different absolute paths in each environment.

**No host config change needed.** For every workspace whose `.git/config` is a regular file (i.e. the main repo, not a worktree pointer), `claude-docker` overlays a container-only copy of `.git/config` that declares `extensions.relativeWorktrees = true` and `worktree.useRelativePaths = true`. The host's on-disk `.git/config` is never touched. Worktrees created inside the container therefore get relative paths, and those link files are then portable to the host without any opt-in.

This asymmetry is deliberate: the extension flag — when written into the host's `.git/config` — blinds tools that bundle an older libgit2 (notably `gitstatusd`, which powers the Powerlevel10k git prompt), because they refuse to open a v1 repo declaring an extension they don't know. Keeping the flag container-only sidesteps that.

To convert pre-existing absolute-path worktrees: from inside the container, run `git worktree repair --relative-paths <worktree-path>`. New worktrees added in the container get relative paths automatically.

**Trade-off:** container-side `git config` writes (e.g. `git remote add ...` writing to local config) land in the ephemeral overlay and are discarded when the container exits. Persistent `git config` edits should happen on the host.

**Fallback — `git worktree repair` (no flag), inside the container:**

```bash
git worktree repair
```

Use this when you passed a repo and a *sibling* worktree as separate workspace args (`claude-docker ~/repo ~/repo-feature`). Sibling-flattened mounts collapse the parent directory, so the relative offset between worktree and repo is not preserved by the bind mount and relative paths can't help.

**Caveats:**

- The overlay only applies to workspaces whose `.git` is a real directory (the main repo). If you mount only a worktree without its main repo, no overlay is created for it. Mount the main repo alongside if you need bidirectional worktree work.
- Relative paths assume the worktree's location relative to the repo's `.git/` is the same in both environments. Nested layouts (e.g. `<repo>/.claude/worktrees/<name>`) always satisfy this; moving a worktree to a totally different parent dir breaks both relative and absolute setups.

## Pasting images

`Cmd-V` to paste a clipboard image doesn't work inside the container — Claude Code reads the macOS clipboard via OS APIs that a Linux container can't reach. Workaround: save the image into any workspace you mounted (e.g. `Cmd-Shift-4` to Desktop, then move it into `~/repo`) and reference it from Claude with `@screenshot.png`.

## Split-pane agent teams

Claude's teammate feature needs tmux. Two modes:

| Flag       | Env var equivalent       | Effect |
|------------|--------------------------|--------|
| *(none — default)* | *(unset)*        | No tmux. Teammates fall back to Claude's **in-process** mode; cycle with Shift+Down. |
| `--tmux`   | `CLAUDE_DOCKER_TMUX=1`   | Plain tmux. Teammates = tmux splits in one terminal tab; switch with `C-b` + arrow keys. Any terminal. |
| `--iterm`  | `CLAUDE_DOCKER_TMUX=cc`  | `tmux -CC` (iTerm2 control mode). Teammates = **native iTerm2 panes/tabs**. macOS + iTerm2 only. |

The env vars are handy for `export` in your shell rc; the flags are handy for one-offs. Both modes need `teammateMode` set in `settings.docker.json` — see [`examples/settings.docker.json`](examples/settings.docker.json). The image already bakes in `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`, so you don't need to add that env var yourself.

### iTerm2 tips for `cc` mode

- Launch from a tab that is **not** already inside a host `tmux -CC` session — nesting degrades the inner server to plain splits.
- iTerm2 → Settings → General → tmux → Attaching → **"When attaching, restore windows as:"** → `Tabs in the attaching window` keeps the gateway and Claude's content inside one iTerm2 window (default is `Native windows`, which spawns a separate window).
- iTerm2 → Settings → General → tmux → **"Automatically bury the tmux client session after connecting"** → hides the `** tmux mode started **` gateway tab on attach so only the Claude tab is visible. Retrieve the gateway later via Session → Buried Sessions if needed.
- The UTF-8 warning from earlier builds is resolved — the image sets `LANG=C.UTF-8` and `run.sh` passes `tmux -u`.

## Extending the image

When a project needs extra tooling (language runtimes, package managers, project-scoped CLIs) that doesn't belong in the base image, build a child image and reuse this wrapper via the `CLAUDE_DOCKER_IMAGE` env var — no need to fork `run.sh`.

In the child repo:

```dockerfile
# .claude-docker/Dockerfile
FROM claude-code:local
RUN ...   # add your extras here
```

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# claude-docker (project-root entrypoint)
set -euo pipefail
here=$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)
IMAGE="claude-code-myproject:local"
docker build -t "$IMAGE" "$here/.claude-docker"
CLAUDE_DOCKER_IMAGE="$IMAGE" exec claude-docker "$@"
```

The child Dockerfile uses `FROM claude-code:local` (locally-built tag) — assumes the base has been built once on the host. Every wrapper flag (`--aws`, `--gh`, `--ephemeral`, `--ro`, `--iterm`, …) keeps working because the child script just exec's into this one with a different image tag.

Any extra package managers a child image installs (rustup, go, ruby, etc.) *add* to the runtime code-fetch surface noted under [Threat model](#threat-model) — they don't replace the existing `npx`/`pnpm dlx`/`uvx` primitives.
