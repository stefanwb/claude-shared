# claude-docker

Run Claude Code in a container that inherits your setup but not your filesystem. Workspace access is scoped to the directories you pass in; your statusline, skills, agents, and slash commands ride along as read-only bind-mounts. CLI tools are preinstalled (`gh`, `glab`, `aws`, `openspec`, `uv`, `pnpm`, `tfenv`) — language runtimes are not: `tfenv` and `uv` fetch your project-pinned Terraform / Python on demand. Host credentials (`gh`, `glab`, `aws`, `tfe`) are opt-in per flag; nothing leaks in by default.

Bundled CLIs on the default PATH: `claude`, `gh`, `glab`, `aws` (v2), `openspec`, `uv`, `uvx`, `pnpm`, `pnpx`, `tfenv`. See [Credential opt-in](#credential-opt-in) for `gh` / `glab` / `aws` / `tfe`; `openspec`, the package managers (`uv`/`uvx`/`pnpm`/`pnpx`), and `tfenv` itself need no flags.

## Install

```bash
# Build the image from your checkout (one-time; rerun after Dockerfile changes)
docker build -t claude-code:local ./claude-docker

# Put on your PATH (create ~/bin if it doesn't exist)
mkdir -p ~/bin
ln -s "$(pwd)/claude-docker/run.sh" ~/bin/claude-docker
```

## Usage

```bash
claude-docker                             # current dir as workspace
claude-docker ~/repo-a ~/repo-b           # multi-workspace
claude-docker --yolo ~/repo               # alias for --dangerously-skip-permissions
claude-docker ~/repo -- --resume          # any claude flag after --
```

`claude-docker --help` (or `-h`) prints every wrapper flag with a one-line explanation — the canonical reference.

### Credential opt-in

**Credentials are off by default.** No AWS / GitHub / GitLab config, tokens, or env vars reach the container unless you explicitly opt in:

| Flag         | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| `--aws`      | Mount `~/.aws/config` + `~/.aws/sso` (:ro) and forward `AWS_PROFILE`/`AWS_REGION`/`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`/`AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`. |
| `--gh`       | Forward `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` **and** unmask in-container `gh auth login` state persisted in `claude-code-root`. Without this flag, `/root/.config/gh/` is hidden by a tmpfs overlay so a prior login can't leak into a non-opted-in session. |
| `--glab`     | Mount the platform-appropriate `glab-cli` config dir (:ro) and forward `GITLAB_TOKEN`. Also unmasks any in-container `glab auth login` state; without the flag, `/root/.config/glab-cli/` is hidden by a tmpfs overlay. |
| `--tfe`      | Mount `~/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json` (:ro) when present and forward `TF_TOKEN_app_terraform_io`. Targets `app.terraform.io` (HCP Terraform) only — self-hosted Terraform Enterprise hostnames and other `TF_TOKEN_<host>` variables are out of scope. Without the flag, `/root/.terraform.d/` is hidden by a tmpfs overlay so a prior in-container `terraform login` can't leak. See [Terraform Cloud workflow](#terraform-cloud-workflow). |

Combine as needed: `claude-docker --aws --gh ~/repo`.

### Other hardening flags

| Flag            | Effect |
|-----------------|--------|
| `--ephemeral`   | Skip the `claude-code-root` and `claude-code-home` named volumes. No Claude OAuth token, `gh` login, or conversation history persists across runs. Use for one-shot sessions on untrusted workspaces. |
| `--ro`          | Mount every workspace read-only. Code review / audit mode. |
| `--iterm`       | Wrap `claude` in `tmux -CC` for native iTerm2 split-pane teammates (macOS + iTerm2). See [Split-pane agent teams](#split-pane-agent-teams). |
| `--tmux`        | Wrap `claude` in plain tmux. Teammates render as tmux splits in one terminal tab. Works anywhere. |

Example — review-only session on an untrusted repo, zero creds, no persistence:

```bash
claude-docker --ephemeral --ro ~/untrusted-repo
```

In-container YOLO narrows the blast radius compared to running on the host, but see [Threat model](#threat-model) for what it does and doesn't protect.

### Resuming sessions across workspaces

Conversation history persists in the shared `claude-code-home` volume (skipped under `--ephemeral`), so `claude --resume` followed by `Ctrl+A` lists sessions from every workspace you've ever used — not just the one you're currently in.

## Host config parity

On every run, these items are dereferenced (symlinks resolved) and bind-mounted read-only into the container at the equivalent `/root/.claude/` path:

| Item                              | Purpose                             |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `~/.claude/agents/`               | custom agent definitions            |
| `~/.claude/skills/`               | custom skills                       |
| `~/.claude/commands/`             | slash commands                      |
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`             | global preferences (`gprefs`)       |
| `~/.claude/statusline-command.sh` | statusline renderer                 |

For `settings.json`, maintain a dedicated `~/.claude/settings.docker.json` (any valid Claude `settings.json` schema) — it's bind-mounted at `/root/.claude/settings.json` when present. Keeping it separate from your host `settings.json` avoids dragging macOS-only keys (`sandbox`, `env.SSL_CERT_FILE`, `enabledPlugins`) or host-filesystem `hooks` into the container. See [`examples/settings.docker.json`](examples/settings.docker.json) for a starting point.

### Git identity

`user.name` and `user.email` from your global git config (`~/.gitconfig`) are forwarded automatically as `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`/`GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`/`GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`/`GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` so in-container `git commit` works out of the box with your real identity — no `git -c user.email=...` dance, no wrong-author commits. Not gated by a flag: identity is already public on every commit you've made. Signing keys, credential helpers, aliases, and hooks are NOT forwarded — those are host-specific (keychains, absolute paths) and would misfire inside the container.

### Statusline tag for active opt-ins

`run.sh` exports `CLAUDE_DOCKER_FLAGS` into the container with the comma-separated list of active opt-ins (`gh`, `aws`, `glab`, `ephemeral`, `ro`) and wraps the host statusline script so a yellow `docker:<flags>` tag is prepended to whatever your personal statusline renders. `--yolo` / `--dangerously-skip-permissions` is not surfaced here — Claude Code's own mode indicator already makes it obvious. The wrapper is a no-op passthrough when no opt-ins are active, so your statusline looks unchanged on a plain `claude-docker ~/repo`.

The image sets `IS_SANDBOX=1` so `--yolo` / `--dangerously-skip-permissions` works despite running as root. See [Threat model](#threat-model) below.

## Auth model

Credentials are opt-in per run (see [Credential opt-in](#credential-opt-in) above). When enabled:

| Flag         | Source                                                      |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--gh`       | In-container `gh auth login` persists via `claude-code-root` volume (host macOS Keychain is not reachable), but is only visible when `--gh` is passed — otherwise `/root/.config/gh/` is masked by a tmpfs. Host `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` env vars are forwarded when set. |
| `--glab`     | Read-only bind-mount of `~/Library/Application Support/glab-cli` (macOS) or `~/.config/glab-cli` (Linux). Any in-container `glab auth login` state is likewise only visible under `--glab`; without the flag `/root/.config/glab-cli/` is masked by a tmpfs. Host `GITLAB_TOKEN` env var forwarded when set. |
| `--aws`      | Read-only bind-mount of `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/sso/` only. `~/.aws/credentials` (long-lived keys) and `~/.aws/cli/cache/` are **not** exposed. Host `AWS_PROFILE`/`AWS_REGION`/`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`/`AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` forwarded when set. |
| `--tfe`      | Read-only bind-mount of `~/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json` when present (the file `terraform login` writes). Host `TF_TOKEN_app_terraform_io` forwarded when set. Any in-container `terraform login` state is likewise only visible under `--tfe`; without the flag `/root/.terraform.d/` is masked by a tmpfs. |

### AWS SSO flow (`--aws`)

Standard SSO usage works unchanged: `aws sso login --profile X && export AWS_PROFILE=X` on the host, then `claude-docker --aws`. The container reads the short-lived SSO bearer token from `~/.aws/sso/cache` via the read-only mount.

If you'd rather not mount `sso/cache` either, flatten to env vars after login:

```bash
aws sso login --profile X
eval "$(aws configure export-credentials --profile X --format env)"
claude-docker --aws ...
```

Container then uses `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`SECRET`/`SESSION_TOKEN` and the SSO cache is not needed inside. Temp creds freeze at container start (~1h TTL).

### Terraform Cloud workflow

Standard usage targets `app.terraform.io` (HCP Terraform):

```bash
# One-time on the host: writes ~/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json
terraform login app.terraform.io

# Per session
claude-docker --tfe ~/repo

# Inside the container, fetch the project-pinned terraform version
tfenv install            # reads .terraform-version, downloads from releases.hashicorp.com
terraform plan
```

The image ships `tfenv` (a pure-bash terraform version manager) and **does not** ship a pre-installed `terraform` binary version — versions are project-pinned (`required_version` / `.terraform-version`) and a single bundled version would drift against real workspaces. `tfenv install` writes terraform binaries under `/opt/tfenv/versions/`, which is **not** in the `claude-code-root` named volume; downloads do not persist across `docker run --rm` exits. Power users can build a child image (`FROM claude-code:local`) that runs `tfenv install <version>` at build time to bake a specific version into a derived image.

Token alternative: instead of (or in addition to) the credentials file, export `TF_TOKEN_app_terraform_io=<token>` on the host and `--tfe` will forward it. The terraform CLI honours both.

## Threat model

The container narrows blast radius vs. running `claude --yolo` on the host, but it is **not** a full sandbox:

- **Protected:** host filesystem outside your passed workspaces, host `~/.aws/credentials` (long-lived keys), host AWS/glab config dirs are read-only from inside (container can't persist changes back).
- **Exposed:** your passed workspaces are read-write; short-lived AWS SSO bearer tokens (`~/.aws/sso/cache`) and the glab config token are readable inside the container; `gh`/`GITLAB_TOKEN` env vars are readable; full outbound network.
- **Runtime code-fetch:** `npx`, `pnpm dlx`, `uvx`, and `tfenv install` fetch and execute arbitrary code from public sources on first use — npm and PyPI for the package managers, `releases.hashicorp.com` for `tfenv install`. Under `--yolo`, a prompt-injected workspace can trigger these. `pnpm dlx` adds zero marginal blast radius vs the already-reachable `npx`; `uvx` is a *new* PyPI execution primitive (no Python runtime existed in the image before); `tfenv install` is a *new* HashiCorp release-channel execution primitive whose downloaded `terraform` binary is intentionally **not** sha256-pinned in the image (versions are project-pinned via `.terraform-version`, so the image stays neutral on version policy). Build-time installs of the CLIs themselves are pinned by version + sha256 where the ecosystem supports it (uv binary, glab .deb, AWS CLI, tfenv source archive), and by version only for npm-backed packages (claude-code, openspec, pnpm) — `--ignore-scripts` blocks lifecycle scripts at install time but does not protect against a compromised registry serving a malicious tarball at the pinned version.
- **Implication:** a prompt-injected file in any mounted workspace can exfiltrate those tokens and read/write any workspace. Don't mount repos you don't trust. Rotate tokens if the container is compromised.

Hardening applied: `--cap-drop ALL`, `--security-opt no-new-privileges`, pinned base image + app versions with sha256 verification on downloaded artifacts.

## Git worktrees

Git worktrees embed the path between the worktree and its repo's `.git/` in two link files. By default those paths are absolute, so a worktree created on the host breaks inside the container (and vice versa) because the same files sit at different absolute paths in each environment.

**Recommended (host git ≥ 2.48):** opt in to relative paths once on the host, then worktrees nested inside the repo (e.g. `<repo>/.claude/worktrees/<name>`) round-trip cleanly between host and container — created either side, used from the other — with no repair step.

```bash
# host, one-time per repo (or use --global):
git config worktree.useRelativePaths true

# convert any existing worktree to relative paths:
git worktree repair --relative-paths <worktree-path>
```

After this, `git status` works in both the host and container without further action, including for worktrees created inside the container.

**Fallback — `git worktree repair` (no flag), inside the container:**

```bash
git worktree repair
```

Use this when:

- Your host git is < 2.48 (no `--relative-paths` flag available — `/usr/bin/git` on macOS often lags; Homebrew is usually current).
- You passed a repo and a *sibling* worktree as separate workspace args (`claude-docker ~/repo ~/repo-feature`). Sibling-flattened mounts collapse the parent directory, so the relative offset between worktree and repo is not preserved by the bind mount and relative paths can't help.

**Layout caveat:** relative paths assume the worktree's location relative to the repo's `.git/` is the same in both environments. Nested layouts always satisfy this; moving a worktree to a totally different parent dir breaks both relative and absolute setups.

## Pasting images

`Cmd-V` to paste a clipboard image doesn't work inside the container — Claude Code reads the macOS clipboard via OS APIs that a Linux container can't reach. Workaround: save the image into any workspace you mounted (e.g. `Cmd-Shift-4` to Desktop, then move it into `~/repo`) and reference it from Claude with `@screenshot.png`.

## Split-pane agent teams

Claude's teammate feature needs tmux. Two modes:

| Flag       | Env var equivalent       | Effect |
|------------|--------------------------|--------|
| *(none — default)* | *(unset)*        | No tmux. Teammates fall back to Claude's **in-process** mode; cycle with Shift+Down. |
| `--tmux`   | `CLAUDE_DOCKER_TMUX=1`   | Plain tmux. Teammates = tmux splits in one terminal tab; switch with `C-b` + arrow keys. Any terminal. |
| `--iterm`  | `CLAUDE_DOCKER_TMUX=cc`  | `tmux -CC` (iTerm2 control mode). Teammates = **native iTerm2 panes/tabs**. macOS + iTerm2 only. |

The env vars are handy for `export` in your shell rc; the flags are handy for one-offs. Both modes need `teammateMode` set in `settings.docker.json` — see [`examples/settings.docker.json`](examples/settings.docker.json). The image already bakes in `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`, so you don't need to add that env var yourself.

### iTerm2 tips for `cc` mode

- Launch from a tab that is **not** already inside a host `tmux -CC` session — nesting degrades the inner server to plain splits.
- iTerm2 → Settings → General → tmux → Attaching → **"When attaching, restore windows as:"** → `Tabs in the attaching window` keeps the gateway and Claude's content inside one iTerm2 window (default is `Native windows`, which spawns a separate window).
- iTerm2 → Settings → General → tmux → **"Automatically bury the tmux client session after connecting"** → hides the `** tmux mode started **` gateway tab on attach so only the Claude tab is visible. Retrieve the gateway later via Session → Buried Sessions if needed.
- The UTF-8 warning from earlier builds is resolved — the image sets `LANG=C.UTF-8` and `run.sh` passes `tmux -u`.

## Extending the image

When a project needs extra tooling (language runtimes, package managers, project-scoped CLIs) that doesn't belong in the base image, build a child image and reuse this wrapper via the `CLAUDE_DOCKER_IMAGE` env var — no need to fork `run.sh`.

In the child repo:

```dockerfile
# .claude-docker/Dockerfile
FROM claude-code:local
RUN ...   # add your extras here
```

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# claude-docker (project-root entrypoint)
set -euo pipefail
here=$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)
IMAGE="claude-code-myproject:local"
docker build -t "$IMAGE" "$here/.claude-docker"
CLAUDE_DOCKER_IMAGE="$IMAGE" exec claude-docker "$@"
```

The child Dockerfile uses `FROM claude-code:local` (locally-built tag) — assumes the base has been built once on the host. Every wrapper flag (`--aws`, `--gh`, `--ephemeral`, `--ro`, `--iterm`, …) keeps working because the child script just exec's into this one with a different image tag.

Any extra package managers a child image installs (rustup, go, ruby, etc.) *add* to the runtime code-fetch surface noted under [Threat model](#threat-model) — they don't replace the existing `npx`/`pnpm dlx`/`uvx` primitives.
